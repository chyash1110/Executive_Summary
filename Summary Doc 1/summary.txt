The system is designed to be robust, scalable, and user-friendly. It includes a Random Forest Regression model trained to predict the spread time of fires based on environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, distance, terrain type, and vegetation type. The model utilizes a dataset of historical fire incidents to make accurate predictions, enabling proactive measures to be taken before the fire spreads uncontrollably. It also includes an integrated booking system for arranging transportation services required for firefighting operations. This feature ensures resources can be mobilized quickly and efficiently. A web-based platform for reporting fire incidents in real-time. A system for booking transportation services for firefighting resources. Historical data analysis to identify patterns and trends. An AI-driven system to induce rain with artificial sodium content using drones to induce forest fires. The study highlights the integration of sensors and IoT for early warning and detection, aimed at assisting firefighting efforts effectively. It also highlights the need for early detection to prevent loss of life and property due to fires. It proposes an IoT-based automated detection and prevention of forest fires for early prevention and prevention. The data was collected from historical fire incidents. A Random Forest Regressor was chosen for its robustness and ability to handle nonlinear relationships in the data. The trained model was serialized using and deployed via a Flask web application. Users can send POST requests to the /predict endpoint with relevant features. The app processes the input, scales the features, and returns the predicted fire spread time. The integration of the machine learning model with the Flask app is achieved through a seamless workflow. The system uses a Random Forest Regression model to predict the spread time of forest fires. The data quality of the dataset and the careful preprocessing of data significantly affected the model's performance. Users found the web interface intuitive and easy to use for reporting new fire incidents. The system's architecture was designed to be scalable, handling increasing amounts of data and user requests efficiently. Future work should focus on continuously improving the system by incorporating more diverse and real-time data sources. The Fire Risk Management System addresses a critical need in the Forest Fire Management System. The Fire Risk Management System provides a comprehensive solution for predicting, reporting, and managing forest fires. The system's predictive capabilities enable proactive measures, potentially saving lives, property, and natural resources by providing accurate forecasts of fire spread. The integration of this model with a web-based platform ensures that the solution is both practical and accessible to users across different roles, including the general public, forest department personnel, and transportation service providers. There are several areas for future enhancement and development. The study is based on a deep neural network-based framework. It is the first of its kind to use artificial intelligence to predict forest fire spread.
